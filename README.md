# Modified Copy of Sales prediction

**Sojood AbuAlrub** : 

### Business problem:
This project predicts sales using Random Forest and Linear Regression models. Key modifications involve leveraging feature importance from Random Forest and coefficients from Linear Regression to improve prediction accuracy and interpretability.


### Dataset:
The dataset "From Kaggle" was focused on Sale Prediction for food items sold at various stores. There were 8523 Rows and 12 Volumns.
The target was to predicr the Item_Outlet_Sales

## Methods
- Random Forest: The top 5feature importances were Item_MRP, Outlet_Type_Grocery Store, Item_Visibility, Outlet_Type_Supermarket Type3, Outlet_Establishment_Year
These scores to identify the most influential predictors of sales.

- Linear Regression: The coefficients were analyzed to evaluate each featureâ€™s direct impact on sales, highlighting any positively or negatively associated features. The most Coefficients were: Outlet_Location_Type_Tier Item_Fat_Content_Regular	and Item_Type_Soft Drinks
